I developed an active interest in learning programming, since it 
appealed to me as a creative art based on logic. The idea that every 
individual could have their own perspective to approach the same problem 
with different quantifiable results intrigued me. I therefore, decided 
to pursue Computer Science as my undergraduate course of study at RVCE. 
My undergraduate studies helped me understand the research scope of 
Computer Science and has been instrumental in motivating me towards 
research. I feel that Masters in Computer Science at your university is 
the next logical step for me to deepen my understanding of Computer 
naturally inclined towards learning Algorithm Design and Complexity 
Theory at my undergraduate studies. Developing algorithmic solutions 
based on same set of simple principles for various complex problems 
provided me a sense of satisfaction and thus motivated me to seek more 
challenging problems. Therefore, I spent a significant amount of time 
during my sophomore year working various competitive programming 
challenges. Competitive programming experience improved my skills to 
analyze and design software systems, and also as a result of which I was 
able to represent my college at ACM ICPC national onsite competition.

Working on programing challenges made me observe a generic pattern with 
I approached any given problem. This made me wonder if a universal 
solution existed to solve any problem! The thought provoked me to 
explore the field of Artificial Intelligence and later Machine Learning. 
In order to improve my understanding of Artificial Intelligence and 
Machine Learning I audited various online courses and also pursued 
elective courses at college to improve my learning of Artificial 
Intelligence. During this time, I got an opportunity to contribute to 
one of my friend’s research initiative involving deep learning known as 
Invalidized Learning. Our idea was to develop a learning model that will 
be able to distinguish actual data from its synthetically generated 
distorted version. When we used Convolutional Neural Networks to perform 
classification on CIFAR-10 dataset, the network was able to learn the 
hierarchical representations. Invalidized Learning was my first research 
initiative in deep learning and this project helped me understand the 
difference between generative and discriminative models, consequently 
leading to my interest in learning Generative Models.

My elective course in Game Theory introduced me to various concepts like 
Nash equilibrium and Min-max games. As an application of these concepts 
with generative models, I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks as 
part of my Minor thesis. My teammates and I worked on developing a Deep 
Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for generating images from 
the CelebA image dataset. Using this framework, we demonstrated how each 
image in the dataset could be represented by a semantic vector in latent 
space, and how images could be morphed just by manipulating these 
vectors. Since, this project was a combination of some concepts of Game 
Theory and Deep Learning, it changed my perspective regarding the scope 
of Deep Learning and has been pivotal in my decision to pursue graduate 
studies.

At the end of my third year, I got an opportunity to intern with 
Innovation and Advanced Technology Team (IAT) at Intuit. IAT aimed at 
developing a Conversational Commerce System that can effectively prepare 
meeting notes from conversation of small business owners. As a proof of 
concept, I developed a Dialogue State Tracking System using word 
embeddings to generate vector representation of each utterance and then 
used LSTM network to accurately track the context and subject of 
conversation. This project enabled me to significantly understand 
working of sequence and memory based models. During my final semester, I 
worked on Hierarchical Recurrent Models and their application in Spoken 
Language Understanding. I’m trying to document this work for a peer 
reviewed journal publication.

My undergraduate course has provided me with an opportunity to cover 
breadth of courses across various domains of Computer Science. Every 
project and internship I worked on, has further escalated my interest to 
pursue research in Computer Science. I feel that pursuing graduate 
studies at Texas A&M university will be the right step for me to enhance 
my knowledge and skills necessary towards this goal. Graduate studies 
provide great freedom to pursue courses in our fields of interest, and 
hence I feel it will enable to me to narrow down my research focus.

Based on my research and academic experiences I’m confident that I will be able to meet the expected standards of your institution.
